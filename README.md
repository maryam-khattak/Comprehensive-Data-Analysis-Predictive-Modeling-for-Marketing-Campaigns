# Comprehensive-Data-Analysis-Predictive-Modeling-for-Marketing-Campaigns
This project involves a detailed analysis of a marketing campaign dataset from a retailer company. It includes data understanding, preparation, exploration, and predictive modeling using Python. The dataset comprises 1,500 customer records with various socio-demographic and product ownership attributes. The primary goal is to predict customer affinity using logistic regression.

**Key Components**:  
• **Data Understanding**: Creation of a metadata table with statistics and histograms for numeric data; analysis of missing or erroneous data.  
• **Data Preparation**: Reduction of variables and data cleaning, transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.  
• **Data Analysis**: Summary statistics including sum, mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.  
• **Data Exploration**: Interactive histogram plotting for user-selected variables.  
• **Data Mining**: Development of a logistic regression model using 1,000 random records; implementation of a prediction application with a user-friendly interface; evaluation of model accuracy with a test set of 100 records.  
• **Reflection**: Discussion of methodologies and findings from the analysis.  

**Technologies Used**:     
• **Language**: Python  
• **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
• **Tools**: Google Colab, Git Hub  

**Benefits**:
